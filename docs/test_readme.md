# Test Directory Documentation

This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

## About Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use. This approach helps find problems early in the development cycle, making debugging easier and improving overall code quality.

## PlatformIO Unit Testing

PlatformIO provides a powerful unit testing framework that allows you to create and run tests for your embedded projects. This is particularly useful for ensuring your code works correctly before deploying it to hardware.
